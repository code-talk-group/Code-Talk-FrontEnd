## Description  

**Code Talk** aids users in learning to coherently verbalize their code.

New developers often struggle to talk through their code with confidence.  **Code Talk** offers users the opportunity to select a customized line of code and receive feedback on how to vocalize the method and it's contents.

With **Code Talk** users can gain the confidence they need to establish connections through high level conversations with fellow developers.
